//! What colour text is drawn in when it was first shaped inside a mid-frame settle.
//!
//! A virtualised list builds its rows when a geometry observation is delivered, which happens in
//! the middle of the frame: the delivery is flushed, and the document is restyled and laid out
//! again before the frame paints. Text shaped there claims its brush slot against the cascade
//! result it was styled by, exactly as text shaped in the main pass does — and the main pass runs
//! the brush step between its cascade and its layout, so a slot claimed there is one the frame
//! knows about. A settle that skips the step leaves the row shaped into a slot nothing rewrites,
//! and every later colour change misses it: the cascade reports the new colour and the glyphs
//! keep the old one, for as long as the shaping survives.
