//! A row whose background changed is never replayed from the painting it had before.
//!
//! A paint-only change moves nothing: the fragment keeps its rectangle and its content, and the
//! one thing that tells the painter to encode it again rather than replay last frame's recording
//! is the lowered style the fragment resolves to. That lowering is cached by the identity of the
//! cascade's property groups, which are addresses — and an address is only an identity while the
//! allocation behind it is alive. A row hovered, left, and hovered again allocates and frees its
//! background group every time, so the allocator hands the same block back; a cache that kept
//! only the numbers then answers the hovered style with the un-hovered lowering, and the row is
//! replayed without its highlight, with correct damage and nothing to report it.
//!
//! Two hundred hovers, because the reuse is the allocator's decision and not the frame's.
