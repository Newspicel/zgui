//! Where a node is, as an accessibility tree measures it.
//!
//! Two decisions are baked in here rather than left to each call site.
//!
//! **Bounds are the union of a node's fragments.** An element that breaks across two columns or
//! three lines is one node with one rectangle, because that is the thing a consumer draws a
//! highlight around.
//!
//! **Bounds are in CSS pixels and the root carries the scale.** Reporting device pixels would work
//! until the window moved to a display of a different scale, at which point every node in the tree
//! would have to be rewritten to say the same thing in different numbers.
//!
//! **Bounds are resolved through the coordinate system the fragment is in.** A fragment keeps its
//! rectangle in its own space, which is the space its clip, its corner radii and its children are
//! expressed in and is *not* where it is drawn as soon as anything above it carries a transform.
//! Reading the fragment's own rectangle gives a consumer the rectangle the element would occupy if
//! nothing had moved it — a highlight drawn half a panel away from the control it belongs to, and
//! an element being animated reported at the place it started from for the whole animation.
