//! What changing a document costs the box tree that was built from it.
//!
//! A box's name is what fragment reuse, geometry diffing and damage scissoring are keyed on, so
//! "the tree was rebuilt" and "the tree was patched" are not two ways of getting the same answer:
//! the first makes every downstream cache miss. Every assertion here is therefore about the names
//! as much as about the content — that the boxes are the ones that were already there, *and* that
//! what they now hold is what the document says.
